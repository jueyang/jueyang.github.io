Today I read about Thomas Nozkowski, a review written by John Yau, a critic I admire.

I read that for decades Nozkowski used prepared canvas available from art supply stores, defying the idea of stretching your own and being an art hero.

I read that his works are literal, where shapes are shapes, lines lines, and colors colors — no symbolism.

I googled his name and read the New York Times review on how he used drawing to "cool down" after he made paintings, instead of seeing drawings as pre-painting sketches. I scrolled through the images in this review, enlarged them, panned them around and felt — emitting from them — something honest and pleasant.

"Pleasant" is not a word I thought I would use to describe art. 

I have been defaulting to extracting meanings beyond aesthetics. In the process of tirelessly reading things and reading into them, I discovered that I have become picky. For example:

I am not a big fan of any art that lectures me about how the world works or should work.

I am not interested in any art that quotes theory heavily or touts "research" as the mainstay of its creation.

I am weary of reading politically correct statements (okay, this one applies to art and beyond).

I become easily overwhelmed by loud sounds, flashes, fast-cut moving images, total darkness, conceptual play (whatever that means), embodied gestures (whatever that means), speculative performances (whatever that means), positionality (whatever that means)...

I have started to think that, perhaps, I don't really like art.

But reading about Thomas Nozkowski and looking at his images, I realize it's not that I don't like art, it's that I have somehow acquired a sadistic lens when it comes to seeing art.

I thought I should look at smart art, important art, complicated art, when in reality, I am probably better off looking at things that don't strain my brain — or, at a more fundamental level, my eyes.

Seeing Nozkowski's work is like having a day of sun amongst a season of wind and gloom. It's a reminder that even though I keep saying "I like weather", what I might actually like is the beach (without weather).

I read that Thomas Nozkowski is no longer alive and that I can buy his work for $10,000.

I don't know, should I buy it?
