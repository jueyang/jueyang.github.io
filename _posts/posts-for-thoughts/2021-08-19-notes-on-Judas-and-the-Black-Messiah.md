title: 'Notes on Judas and the Black Messiah'
---

Finally watched _Judas and the Black Messiah_. Chest heavy with anger, desperation and sometimes, with pride. Witnessed solidarity, union, friendship. Smiles rippled from: tenderness of young love, expecting motherhood in tumultuous times, poetry. Smiles ripped away by: betrayal, murder, injustice, the inevitabilities of such.

The film starts with a re-enactment of a TV interview with the protagonist, William O'Neal, then cuts to various historical footage of the Black civil uprisings in the late 60's. These grainy scenes — with wide black edges on both sides — are associated with analog film (which, in broadcast, is a thing of the past). The the next shot follows a pair of shoes walking on sidewalks lit green at night. The image surface becomes smooth as the aspect ratio changes to occupy the entirety of the cinema screen. This image exudes the quality of the present: it marks the beginning of the story, which I, the viewer, now know happens in the midst of the civil movement of the Black Panther Party. What a reversal of aesthetics: the aesthetics of archive footage conjures up a sense of opening — a prelude of a fiction based on — and dramatizes — real events, while the aesthetics of contemporary cinema alerts me that I am now looking back at history, more closely than ever.

The re-enactment shot from the interview — appearing in the opening and, once again, in the first half of the film — merges the fictional character with documented events. The actual footage from the TV interview — featuring the very William O'Neal whom the character has been portraying — occurs at the end of the film. Up till this moment, re-enactment has expanded the story to accomodate a more nuanced reading. This moment from the actual footage — deliberately collapsing re-enactment and reality — calls for my sober judgement (despite the dried trails of tears). I am back in the real, now equipped with the articulation of history. In fact, I am back _in awe of_ the real.

Good dramatization is one that re-examines reality, defines its crucial moments and broadens the understanding of reality itself. Good dramatization gives shape to the complexity of one's demons and one's fallibility and reveals the inner lives of hearts to the heart of the viewers.

This film is full of good dramatization.
