title: 'Notes on Judas and the Black Messiah'

Finally watched it. Chest heavy with anger, desperation and sometimes, with pride. Witnessed solidarity, union, friendship. Smiles rippled from: tenderness of young love, expecting motherhood in tumultuous times, poetry, and ripped by: betrayal, murder, injustice, the inevitabilities of such.

The film starts with a re-enactment of a TV interview with the protagonist, William O'Neal, then cuts to various historical footage of the Black civil uprisings in the late 60's. These grainy scenes — with wide black edges on both sides — are associated with analog film (which, in broadcast, is a thing of the past). The the next shot follows a pair of shoes walking on the sidewalk lit green at night. The image surface becomes smooth as the aspect ratio changes to occupy the entirety of the cinema screen. This image exudes the quality of the present: it marks the beginning of the story, which happens during the times of the Black Panther Party, as contextualized by the previous footage. 

The "old" and "new" looks signify different modes of story-telling and strike me as skillful and precise. While the aesthetics of archive footage conjures up the prelude of a fiction based on real events, that of contemporary cinema alerts me that I am now looking back at history, more closely than ever.

The re-enactment shot from the interview — appearing in the opening and, once again, in the first half of the film — merges the fictional character with documented events. The actual footage from the TV interview — featuring the very William O'Neal whom the character has been portraying — occurs at the end of the film. Up till this moment, re-enactment has expanded the story to accomodate a more nuanced reading. This moment from the actual footage — deliberately collapsing re-enactment and reality — calls for my sober judgement (despite trails of tears now dried on my cheeks). I am summoned back to the real, now equipped with the articulation of history.

Good dramatization is one that re-examines reality, defines its crucial moments and broadens the understanding of reality itself. The facts and chornologies might shift in this expansion, but good dramatization is not about adherence, but rather about the evocation. What is the shape of complexity of one's demons and one's fallibility, and how do the inner lives of hearts travel to the heart of the viewers? T

This film is full of good dramatization.
