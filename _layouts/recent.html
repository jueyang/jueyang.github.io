		<p><em>To be of the Middle World is to have broken away from the parochial, to have left "home" for good (or for worse) whilst carrying all of it with you and to have arrived on foreign shores (at the onset you thought of it as "destination", but not for long) feeling at ease there without ever being "at home". Sensing too, that one has now fatally lost the place you may have wanted to run back to.</em></p>
