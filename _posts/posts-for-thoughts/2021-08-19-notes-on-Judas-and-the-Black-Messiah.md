title: 'Notes on Judas and the Black Messiah'
---

Finally watched _Judas and the Black Messiah_. Chest heavy with anger, desperation and sometimes, with pride. Witnessed solidarity, union, friendship. Smiles ripped from tenderness of young love, expecting motherhood in tumultuous times, poetry, which made the inevitabilities — betrayal, murder, injustice — more crushing. 

The film starts with a re-enactment of footage from a TV interview with the protagonist, William O'Neal, then cuts to various historical footage of the Black civil uprisings in the late 60's. These grainy scenes with black edges on both sides are associated with analog film — a thing of the past in broadcast. In the aesthetics of yesteryear we, the viewers, are given the prelude of a fiction "based on real events" — a fiction that dramatizes real moments. The the next shot follows a pair of shoes walking on sidewalks lit green at night. The image surface becomes smooth as the aspect ratio changes to occupy the entirety of the cinema screen. The image exudes the quality of the present — it marks the beginning of the story, which we now know happens in the midst of a civil movement. What a reversal: the aesthetics of contemporary cinema alerts that we are now looking back at history, and we are looking more closely than ever.

The re-enactment shot from the interview — appearing in the opening and once again in the first half of the film — merges the fictional character with documented events. The actual footage from the TV interview — with the very William O'Neal whom the character has been portraying — occurs at the end of the film. Up till this moment, re-enactment has expanded the story to accomodate a more nuanced reading. This moment — deliberately collapsing re-enactment and reality — calls for our soberiety. We are back in the real, now equipped with the articulation of history (albeit not necessarily historical facts or chronology).

We are back in awe of the real.

Good dramatization is one that re-examines reality, defines its crucial moments and broadens the understanding of reality itself. Good dramatization gives shape to the complexity of one's demons and one's fallibility and reveals the inner lives of hearts to the heart of the viewers.

This film is full of good dramatization.
