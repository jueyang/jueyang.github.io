		<p>Hi, I'm Jue. I am a writer, filmmaker, artist and critic. I enjoy bubble tea and good pizza. I don't drink coffee as much as I used to. I have many plants, some are alive and some dying. I love a good sleep, ocassional indulgence, my parents and my partner. Currently, I am rethinking about why I have a website and what I want to put on it. </p>
		<p>During this restructuring period, I will not be linking to my cv, portfolio or archive. (I suppose if you search hard enough on the internet, you will come across certain fragments. In that case: thank you for your curiosity!)</p> 
		<p>I will, nevertheless, make my <a href="thoughts">thoughts</a> available â€” however performative they appear on the web.</p>
		<p>Of course I still remain reachable. You can email me: jue[at]lemony.space</p>
