my slumber started before the jump

"incessant rain", I read in an old journal

12 was the age of learning the word _incessant_

could not think of other instances of _incessant_

_incessant_ numbness  
_incessant_ loss  
_incessant_ misunderstanding  

did not know the words for 

numbness  
loss  
misunderstanding  

no, they never teach these in school

no, they never talk about these in the family

also, in a play, never write things like "you _never_ take the trash out", "you _never_ come in time", "I _never_ said this", etc etc

it provokes a response that is "I _did_ it last time!", "You just said it now!" (always with exclamation marks, by the way) 

which is to say, the arguments become predictable & trite, and unless the realism is something you can see through and use deliberately, it creates stale dialogues, unevolved psychology and

anyway

had no idea of these words

so instead called them 

_rain_

28 was the age of writing a play that ended with 

a man's monologue over

rain

spelling

p-i-t-t-e-r-p-a-t-t-e-r

blood rushed towards eyes

words smudged and scrambled

10,474

then 732 fewer

then 1,049 more

sent as a heavy envolope with an address soon to be emptied

lost as

legs leapt  
loon loomed  
lance lacerated

it was too easy to make the end of the world a sacrifice

too easy to call it the end

if not the end 

death or uncertainty?
